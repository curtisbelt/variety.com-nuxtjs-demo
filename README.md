# Nuxt.js Template

> My personal [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) template used for starting other projects.

At first, it won't be much different than using [create-nuxt-app](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app) with the equivalent options selected - however I will continue to maintain this repo, adding features and configurations that meet my personal preferences.

## Features :tada:

- ESLint `yarn lint`
- Prettier `yarn format`
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (git hooks).


## Usage

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
yarn build
yarn start

# generate static project
yarn generate
```
